# SpeedCoach

### Stroke WhaAAAAaat?
  A Stroke Coach is a product produced by [NK Sports](https://nksports.com/category-strokecoach-and-speedcoach). This device monitors and displays live data to the athlete and coach. Such information includes:
  * Strokes per minute
  * Distance travelled
  * Time
  * Speed


   This company has a complete monopoly on electronic hardware for rowing around the world. More often then not, cost is a major factor in the recent decrease in participants. Moreover, the lack of equipment in more rural rowing clubs results in a lack ability to send data to post secondary recruiters. By providing a cheap open source alternative people that may not be able to afford school will have access to scholarships.
